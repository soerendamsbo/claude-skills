# /context-status — Check Session Health

Show the current session status including context usage estimate, active plan,
and preservation state.

## What This Skill Shows

1. **Context usage estimate** — Approximate % of context window used
2. **Active plan** — Current plan file and status
3. **Session log** — Most recent session log
4. **Preservation state** — What will survive compaction

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Context Monitor Cache

Read the context monitor cache to get the current estimate:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/sessions/*/context-monitor-cache.json 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

### Step 2: Find Active Plan

```bash
ls -lt quality_reports/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -3
```

### Step 3: Find Session Log

```bash
ls -lt quality_reports/session_logs/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

### Step 4: Report Status

Format the output:

```
📊 Session Status
─────────────────────────────────
Context Usage:  ~XX% (estimated)
Auto-compact:   [approaching | not imminent]

📋 Active Plan
File:   quality_reports/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md
Status: [draft | approved | in_progress | completed]
Task:   [current unchecked task or "none"]

📝 Session Log
File:   quality_reports/session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md

✓ Preservation Check
  • Pre-compact hook: [configured | missing]
  • Post-compact restore: [configured | missing]
  • Session state will be saved before compaction
```

## Notes

- Context % is an estimate based on tool call count
- Actual compaction is triggered by Claude Code automatically
- All important state is saved to disk (plans, logs, MEMORY.md)
